# UFOs

## Overview of Project
# Background: 

Dana’s webpage and dynamic table are working as intended, but she’d like to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, you’ll add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.



## Purpose:

This project focuses on building a dynamic webpage that accepts user inputs and adjusts accordingly to display information about UFO sightings.

In order to perform their analysis, the users will be able to filter the UFO sightings table based on different criteria such as the event date, city, state, country and shape.

## Results:

- User can click on the small logo on top which will refresh the page.

## Analysis:

- Drawback:

The drawback of the website and the design is that the parameter of the searches and filters done is not clear to the user, so it is difficult for the user to know exactly what to search for.  

- 2 further developments:

The 2 different ways we would be able to further develop the site are that including a button on the bottom of the search filters to be able to clear everything in the filters, that would help make the website more user friendly. The second way to improve is to add a drop down on the filters to help show the users how they can filter the different search bars. Having the code to be able to update as soon as new data has been added.
