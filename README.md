# UFOs

## Overview of Project
# Background: 

Dana’s webpage and dynamic table are working as intended, but she’d like to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, you’ll add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.



## Purpose:

This project focuses on building a dynamic webpage that accepts user inputs and adjusts accordingly to display information about UFO sightings.

In order to perform their analysis, the users will be able to filter the UFO sightings table based on different criteria such as the event date, city, state, country and shape.

## Results:

- User can click on the small logo on top which will refresh the page.
